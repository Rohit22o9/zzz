  - Added all referenced HTML pages (risk-analysis.html, simulation.html, optimization.html, monitoring.html, visualization.html)
  - Configured static web server on port 5000
  - Set up deployment configuration for autoscale

## Project Architecture
- **Type**: Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript website
- **Server**: Python HTTP server serving static files
- **Port**: 5000 (configured for Replit environment)
